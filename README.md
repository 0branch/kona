To compile (OS X/Linux/BSD):

    make           #gmake on BSD

To start the interpreter

    ./k

To start the interpreter with tests in debug mode 

    ./k_test

rlwrap makes the k command line interface much nicer. rlwrap adds history and eliminates the "^[[A^[[A^[[D^[[C^..." problem

    rlwrap ./k


Kona is the open-source implementation of the K programming language. If you don't know APL, then this is the place to start. K is an ASCII-based APL. KDB (or Q) is the popular database software built on top of K. K was originally designed by Arthur Whitney and Kx Systems. Kona is unaffiliated with Kx.
